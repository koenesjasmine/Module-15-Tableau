# Citi Bike Sharing

This analysis was conducted to understand the bike sharing market and its users in New York City. The analysis and its visualizations will be used for a bike sharing app proposal in Des Moines. The main data used for this purpose is Citi Bike data that has been released to the public.

> ### Checkout Times for all users

A Typical trip duration for a majority of riders are roughly between 10-20 minutes with a steep dropoff thereafter. This information may help us to understand the types of bikes we may need, and if we consider any electrification of the bikes how the charge times will need to last.

> ### Checkout Times by Gender

This diagram shows the breakdown of trip duration by gender. We see a relatively similar ride time between men and women, with significantly more male riders than female, and we of course have a small quanitiy of undisclosed gender.

> ### Trips for the week by hour

This image shows the relative frequency of ridership across hours of the day and each day of the week. As noted previously we can see a higher usage rate on weekdays from 6 a.m. - 9 a.m. and again from 4 p.m. - 7 p.m. during morning and evening commute hours respectively. On weekends we see a relatively steady usage rate from about 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Similar to the previous above image, however has the breakdown by gender. Again we see a similar overall trend between men and women, but with notably more male riders.

> ### Trips per day by User & Gender

This image shows a breakdown of daily rider usage by user type and gender. Notably more of our riders tend to be subscribed users, and again a significant portion of the customers are subscribed males. Weekedays tend to see more ridership generally with an interesting lull on Wednesday and a peak on Thursday.

## Summary
Based on the data provided it would seem that Males are the highest users of the bike sharing program, and the peak hours of use being between 7 a.m. - 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. - 7 p.m. This along with the data showing the top starting and ending locations to be deep within the city would suggest that most users are using these bikes to commute to and from work. 
> Some additional insights that may be helpful:

* find the average or typical starting and ending locations so that we can prepare our inventory to be available in those locations for the commute hours
* breakdown the similar starting and ending location by gender, weekday, and subscribed customers to understand if there are notable different usage patterns. perhaps non-subscribed customers are tourists who are traveling to and from different tourist spots rather than work locations like our subscribed customers.
